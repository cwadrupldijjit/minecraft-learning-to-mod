# Learning to Mod Minecraft

This is my first foray into modding minecraft. It is meant to eventually resemble the game PlateUp!, which is made by the company `It's happening` and published by Yogscast Games.  It is not meant to be a replacement of that game and will include some of its own unique twists.

This will only give an overview, some tips on how to set up and work on the project, and some findings from when things didn't go so well and how it was fixed.  It is likely to be filled out with other information as time continues.
